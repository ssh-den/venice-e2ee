/**
 * Parse an SSE stream from Venice's chat completions endpoint and yield
 * decrypted text chunks. Each SSE event contains a JSON object with
 * `choices[0].delta.content` holding an encrypted hex string (or plaintext
 * for whitespace tokens).
 *
 * A malformed event or a stream that ends without `data: [DONE]` throws, so a
 * visibly truncated response is not mistaken for a complete one. This does not
 * detect whole events dropped, reordered or replayed by a relay.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   const response = await fetch(url, { ... });
 *   for await (const text of decryptSSEStream(response.body, session.privateKey)) {
 *     process.stdout.write(text);
 *   }
